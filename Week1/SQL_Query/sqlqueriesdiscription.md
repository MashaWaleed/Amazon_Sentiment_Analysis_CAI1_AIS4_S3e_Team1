# Comprehensive Description of CustomerFeedbackDB SQL Script

## 1. Database and Table Setup

### Database Creation
The script begins by dropping any existing tables to ensure a clean slate, then creates a new database named `CustomerFeedbackDB`.

### Table Structures
The script creates five main tables:

1. **Customers**
   - Stores unique customer information
   - Fields: CustomerID (PK), ReviewerID, ReviewerName
   - Note: No unique constraint on ReviewerID to allow potential duplicates

2. **Products**
   - Stores unique product information
   - Fields: ProductID (PK), ASIN
   - Note: No unique constraint on ASIN to allow potential duplicates

3. **FeedbackCategories**
   - Stores categories for feedback (not populated in this script)
   - Fields: CategoryID (PK), CategoryName

4. **Feedback**
   - Main table storing all feedback entries
   - Fields: FeedbackID (PK), CustomerID (FK), ProductID (FK), CategoryID (FK), Rating, ReviewText, Summary, ReviewTime, Verified, VoteCount
   - Foreign key relationships to Customers, Products, and FeedbackCategories tables

5. **StagingFeedback**
   - Temporary table for bulk data import
   - Mirrors the structure of the source CSV file

### Relationships
- The Feedback table has foreign key relationships with Customers, Products, and FeedbackCategories tables, establishing a many-to-one relationship between feedback entries and their respective entities.

## 2. Data Import Process

1. **Bulk Insert**
   - Uses BULK INSERT to load data from a CSV file into the StagingFeedback table
   - Specifies field and row terminators, skips the header row, and keeps null values

2. **Data Distribution**
   - Inserts distinct customer data from StagingFeedback into the Customers table
   - Inserts distinct product data from StagingFeedback into the Products table
   - Populates the Feedback table by joining StagingFeedback with Customers and Products tables

## 3. Data Analysis Queries

The script includes ten analytical queries:

1. **Total Feedback Count**
   - Counts all entries in the Feedback table

2. **Overall Average Rating**
   - Calculates the average rating across all feedback

3. **Top 10 Highest-Rated Products**
   - Finds products with the highest average ratings (minimum 5 reviews)

4. **Rating Distribution**
   - Shows the count of feedback for each rating value

5. **Top 5 Most Active Reviewers**
   - Identifies customers with the most reviews

6. **Verified vs. Unverified Purchase Ratings**
   - Compares average ratings between verified and unverified purchases

7. **Monthly Rating Trends**
   - Tracks average ratings over time (by year and month)

8. **Verified vs. Unverified Rating Discrepancies**
   - Identifies products with significant rating differences between verified and unverified purchases

9. **Common Words in Reviews**
   - Analyzes frequently used words in review summaries (excludes common stop words)

10. **Sudden Rating Changes**
    - Detects products with significant month-to-month changes in average rating

## 4. Key Features and Techniques Used

- **Identity Columns**: Used for primary keys to auto-generate unique identifiers
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Ensure data integrity across related tables
- **BULK INSERT**: Efficiently loads large amounts of data from external files
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Used in complex queries for better readability and modularity
- **Window Functions**: LAG() function used to compare data across different time periods
- **String Functions**: CROSS APPLY with STRING_SPLIT for word frequency analysis
- **Aggregation and Grouping**: Extensively used for data summarization and analysis
- **DISTINCT keyword**: Ensures unique entries when populating Customers and Products tables
- **JOIN operations**: Combines data from multiple tables for comprehensive analysis
- **Subqueries and derived tables**: Used in complex analytical queries

## 5. Potential Improvements and Considerations

- **Indexing**: Adding appropriate indexes could improve query performance
- **Partitioning**: For very large datasets, table partitioning could enhance data management and query efficiency
- **Error Handling**: Implementing TRY-CATCH blocks for better error management
- **Data Validation**: Additional checks could be added to ensure data quality during the import process
- **Stored Procedures**: Frequently used queries could be encapsulated in stored procedures for easier maintenance and execution

This script provides a robust foundation for a customer feedback analysis system, allowing for efficient data storage, retrieval, and complex analytical queries.
